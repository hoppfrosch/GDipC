It will in a future release.  This feature was not deliberately removed, it just hasn't been recreated in the new version yet.</s></p><p><a href="../reference/formatting.html#images">Embedded image support</a> has been added to <a href="../download/index.html">Natural Docs 2.1!</a></p><div class="Heading">Customizable Menus</div><p>Natural Docs 1.x had a customizable Menu.txt configuration file so that you could organize the source files exactly how you wanted them and add links.&nbsp; This is no longer supported.&nbsp; The files view will now match the source code's folder structure exactly, since that's what most people wanted anyway.</p><p>Setting a project title, subtitle, copyright, and timestamp are still supported, those properties have just been moved to Project.txt.&nbsp; When you run 2.0 on a 1.x project for the first time it will automatically find those settings in Menu.txt and copy them to Project.txt for you.</p><p>There may be a way to include links on the home page in a future version, but it's not an immediate priority unless people tell me it should be.</p><div class="Heading">Browsable Indexes</div><p>Natural Docs 1.x generated various indexes so you could browse through an alphabetical list of all functions, classes, and other things.&nbsp; The class menu replaces the class index and everything else can be found through search.</p><p>There may be a way to create additional menus to serve as indexes in the future.&nbsp; I'm not sure how many people used the other indexes so how much of a priority this is depends on the feedback I get.</p><div class="Heading">Unprefixed Database Keywords</div><p>By default you can no longer use the keywords table, view, index, cursor, trigger, column, key, and primary key for their respective database comment types.&nbsp; You must use the versions prefixed by &quot;database&quot; or &quot;db&quot; such as &quot;db table&quot;.&nbsp; However, if you have a lot of documentation using the unprefixed forms you can add these keywords back by editing <a href="../reference/comments.txt.html">Comments.txt</a>.&nbsp; It's still possible to use them, they are just no longer the default.</p><p>This was done for consistency and to prevent confusion.&nbsp; Previously you could use just &quot;index&quot; to document a database index but you couldn't use &quot;field&quot; without a prefix because it's a variable keyword.&nbsp; If both require &quot;database&quot; or &quot;db&quot; then it's clear and consistent.&nbsp; Also, while some keywords like &quot;primary key&quot; are clearly database-related, others like &quot;table&quot; are more ambiguous.&nbsp; In fact, &quot;table&quot; is now a variable keyword by default.&nbsp; Again, you can change all of this by editing <a href="../reference/comments.txt.html">Comments.txt</a> if you want.</p><div class="Heading">Separate HTML and Framed HTML Output Formats</div><p>Natural Docs' <a href="new_html_output.html#three_panel_design">three panel design</a> replaced both of them.&nbsp; There is no need for separate output formats anymore.&nbsp; Specifying html or framedhtml on the command line will give you the same result.</p><div class="Heading">Breakable Lists</div><p>Topics.txt (which is now <a href="../reference/comments.txt.html">Comments.txt</a>) had a setting called Break Lists that allowed you to document things with <a href="../reference/comments.html#list_comments">list topics</a> and they would appear as separate topics in the output.&nbsp; That hasn't been recreated in the new version.</p></div></div></div><div class="Footer"><div class="FCopyrightAndTrademark">Copyright © 2020 Code Clear LLC.</div></div></body></html>
